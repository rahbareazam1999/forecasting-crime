There are interesting insights that have come out from the Descriptive Analysis of the Crime in Mexico:


1. Baja California, Mexico and Ciuded de Mexico has a consistently highest rate of crime

2. The time period of 1999 to 2004 has a high rate of crime for majority of states in Mexico

3. Most common crime types found:
	—Common Thief
	—Household crimes
	—Injuries
	—Other Crimes

4. Correlation Matrix:
	-violent crimes  are negatively correlated most with with a high number of suspects of federal crimes
	-violent crimes (robbery, homicides, kidnapping)  are positively correlated most with with a high number of cars and primary activities/employment/unemployment. This means (possibly) that most violent crimes in Mexico take place in urban/semi-urban areas. This also means that there is virtually little or less police control.

	-non-violent crimes also have a similar pattern as of violent crimes
